* Zombie Trellys mode

This is a major mode for interacting with the [[https://code.google.com/p/trellys/][Zombie Trellys system]],
which is a dependently-typed language that is one of the results of
the Trellys project. You can read about Zombie in papers like:
 * [[http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ccasin/papers/combining-TR.pdf][Combining Proofs and Programs in a Dependently Typed Language]] by
   Casingho, Sjöberg and Weirich, POPL 2014
 * [[http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~vilhelm/papers/popl15congruence.pdf][Programming Up to Congruence]] by Sjöberg and Weirich, POPL 2015

This mode is presently derived from =haskell-mode= to get
"good-enough" syntax highlighting and editing commands. If your
Haskell configuration does things that you don't want for Zombie, then
customize =zombie-trellys-mode-hook= to get rid of them. The mode
already takes care of some potentially problematic Haskell minor
modes.
